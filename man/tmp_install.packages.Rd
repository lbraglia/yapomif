\description{
originally function sopkgs in package overflow
}
\details{
This function can be useful when a package is necessary to try to answer a question
on StackOverflow and you know that you won't need it anymore afterward. It will install
one or several packages only for the current R session.

The files are downloaded and installed in a temporary directory, and this
directory is temporarily added to the library tree within which packages are
looked for: (\code{.libPaths}). If you start another R session, the package
won't be accessible as it won't be in the library tree anymore, and as the
files are installed in a temporary directory they should be deleted upon next
reboot (this depends on your operating system).
